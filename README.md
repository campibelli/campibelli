Specifically interested in Low-Level Programming, with a passion for Arduino, C, C++ and Go, my newest-found love.
With a computer in my hand since i was 7, the *necessity* to learn everything on my own, and endless curiosity: I've been exploring various technologies, like Java phones and their intrincasies, Lua game-modding and, most recently, Python Machine Learning!

## My Passion? 💞
Databases! With multiple certificates, for both Data Modeling and real-world application of concepts, i hold constant progress in the studies and updates of [SQLite],[MySQL],[PostgreSQL],[MongoDB],[CouchDB],[REDIS]; And i wish to go further.

## My Projects? ⚙️
- [Unnamed Game]: Soon to share more Details! Old-school shooter fans, keep your heads up.
- [E-Commerce, Angular]: On hold...

## Current Studies ✏️
- Machine Learning/Artificial Inteligence.
- Go

## 💙 Some Interests 💙

### 💬 Linguist <br/> 
I really, reaaaally love learning new languages and its details! I speak Portuguese natively, with long studies in English and Spanish. I'm currently learning 日本語, and Deutsch holds a special spot in my heart!

### 📚 Cyberpunk <br/> 
Obsessed with Mike Pondsmith's universe "Cyberpunk", having read through 'No Coincidence'(Rafał Kosik)  and 'Trauma Team'(Miguel Valderrama), and of course played the game absorbing as much as i could possibly do;
I believe we should strive to a high-technological, high-quality and fair future for everyone.

### 🎸Multi-Instrumentalist <br/> 
Mainly Drums, but also Electric Guitar, Bass and a bit of Synthetizers! Perhaps we could collab outside of coding? 🤟
