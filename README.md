# English
# こんにちは、 My name is Luci!

I'm a Systems Analyst, currently chasing my degree at IMEPAC - Minas Gerais, Brazil.
Specifically interested in Low-Level Programming, laying my passion with Arduino, C, C++ and GoLang, my newest-found love.
With a computer in my hand since i was 7, the *necessity* to learn by myself, and endless curiosity, i've been jumping through technologies: Java phones and their intrinsicabilities, Lua game-modding and, most recently, Python Machine Learning!

## My Passion?
Databases! With multiple certificates, for both Data Modeling and real-world application of concepts, i hold constant progress in the studies and updates of [SQLite],[MySQL],[PostgreSQL],[MongoDB],[CouchDB],[REDIS]; And i wish to go further!

## My Projects?
- [Unnamed Game]: Soon to share more Details! Old-school shooter fans, keep your heads up.
- [E-Commerce | Angular]: Soon!!!

## Current Studies
- Machine Learning/Artificial Inteligence.
- GoLang
- Angular
- More!Databases

## 💙 Some Interests 💙
###📚 Obsessed with Mike Pondsmith's universe "Cyberpunk", having read through 'No Coincidence'(Rafał Kosik)  and 'Trauma Team'(Miguel Valderrama), and of course played the game absorbing as much as i could possibly do;
I believe we should strive to a high-technological, high-quality and fair future for everyone.

###🎸Multi-Instrumentalist
Electric Guitar, Bass, Drums and a bit of Synthetizers! Perhaps we could collab outside of coding? 💙
