Databases! With multiple certificates, for both Data Modeling and real-world application of concepts, i hold constant progress in the studies and updates of [SQLite],[MySQL],[PostgreSQL],[MongoDB],[CouchDB],[REDIS]; And i wish to go further!

## My Projects? ⚙️

## Current Studies ✏️

## 💙 Some Interests 💙

###💬 Linguist
I really, reaaaally love learning new languages and its details! I speak Portuguese natively, with long studies in English and Spanish. I'm currently learning 日本語, and Deutsch holds a special spot in my heart!

###📚 Cyberpunk
Obsessed with Mike Pondsmith's universe "Cyberpunk", having read through 'No Coincidence'(Rafał Kosik)  and 'Trauma Team'(Miguel Valderrama), and of course played the game absorbing as much as i could possibly do;
I believe we should strive to a high-technological, high-quality and fair future for everyone.

###🎸Multi-Instrumentalist
Electric Guitar, Bass, Drums and a bit of Synthetizers! Perhaps we could collab outside of coding? 💙
